This demonstrates useage of techniques from text mining to determine if any
valuable information regarding the differentiation of fiction and nonfiction
can be gleaned from exclusively using sentiment analysis.

This is work for Professor Melissa Crow's Intermediate R ISP for the
2018-2019 academic year at New College of Florida.

The RMD file can be directly used if one wished to run the code interactively,
or one can examine the HTML file for a premade output.

The code presented here uses the Tidyverse, Tidytext, and gutenbergr libraries.
